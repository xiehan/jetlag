# Nara's jetlag tips & playbook

As someone who's lived on three continents, I've spent almost three decades of my life traveling on long flights across many timezones and dealing with the resulting jetlag, including periods when I was traveling US-to-Europe almost every other month to speak at conferences, meaning I had to perfect the art of recovering well enough within ~2 days to be able to give a talk. The below tips and playbook are all ones that I personally follow no matter when I'm traveling east-to-west or west-to-east and what I always recommend to others, especially if you don't travel these kinds of distances frequently and don't know what works best for you.


## Golden Rules

- If you only remember one thing from this guide, it's the following: **the goal is to always stay awake until at least 9pm**. You should be repeating "9pm, just make it to 9pm" to yourself like a mantra. _Why 9pm?_
  - If you're really tired, you might be able to sleep for 9 hours. If you go to sleep at 9pm and sleep for 9 hours, that means you'll wake up at 6am, which is close enough to normal.
  - The goal is to go to sleep when it's dark out and wake up when it's light out. 9pm-6am fits that criteria most of the time in most parts of the world (with a few exceptions, e.g. northern Europe near either solstice).
- Avoid taking naps if you can. If you absolutely cannot get through the day without a nap, aim for a power nap (~20 mins) if possible, and do not nap for more than 1 full sleep cycle (~90 mins). If you can, take your nap with the curtains/blinds open so that your body realizes this is abnormal.
- The trick is to act normal in order to force your body into thinking things are normal as quickly as possible. That means the following:
  - Eat at normal mealtimes. Avoid eating or snacking too much in between meals. If you're not hungry at mealtime, do your best to force yourself to eat something anyway, even if it's something light.
  - Avoid drinking more caffeine than you normally would, tempting as it may be.
  - Avoid drinking more alcohol than you normally would.
- Fresh air and sunlight are key. Take walks outside as much as you can, weather permitting. If the weather forces you to stay inside, try to sit next to a window so that your body still gets to pick up on signals that it's day out. Think of your body as a plant that needs water, light, and fresh air.

## Packing Tips

- Melatonin or any other sleep aid that works well for you (e.g. Zzzquil)
- Energy/granola bars or small, easily-packable snacks of choice (my husband prefers bags of trail mix)
- If you're a tea drinker, bring your own tea bags, particularly ones with low/no caffeine
  - I personally am a huge fan of rooibos because it has an earthy flavor that can serve as a good substitute for coffee when I'm craving it but have already maxed out my caffeine intake for the day
- Optional but recommended, especially if you're 35+: aspirin or your headache remedy of choice

## Playbook

The following playbook is 1-indexed based on your day of arrival, which may or may not be the same as your day of departure (e.g. if you're flying US to Europe on a redeye flight, your day of departure can be considered Day 0, while day of arrival is Day 1).

### Day 1 (Arrival)

#### In the morning / If your flight arrives before ~12pm

- Since they'll generally always feed you on the plane before arrival, you can safely skip breakfast / have that count as your breakfast. If you plan on napping, avoid coffee or caffeinated beverages.
- Unless you got a really solid night's sleep on the plane, you'll want to take a nap as soon as possible when you arrive. It's up to you to do the mental math, but the goal is to make it to 9pm tonight, so if you think you can't do that without a nap, go ahead and do it ASAP.
  - This can be challenging if you're traveling for business because hotels aren't always able to let you check in this early. It's not a bad idea to contact the hotel in advance to request early check-in. This is also one of the reasons why I work to maintain status with hotels and try to stay only at hotels I have status with; they're more likely to fulfill those requests.
  - This is the one exception to the Golden Rule above about never napping more than 90 minutes: **this nap is allowed to be up to 3.5~4 hours long**. The goal is to get about half a night's rest, or ~3 full sleep cycles. Set an alarm clock for +4 hours from now.
  - DO NOT take melatonin or any kind of sleep aid. Those should only be used when you are able to get a full night's sleep, and you're not trying to get a full night's sleep right now.
  - Feel free to close the curtains/blinds for this nap, as the quality of sleep is more important.
  - You might be surprised how long it takes you to fall asleep; you'll feel dead tired when you lie down but then find yourself to still be awake an hour later. You might also feel like you're only dozing and not fully asleep. This is okay. I personally have found that there are still a lot of benefits to being horizontal and stretched out after spending 6+ hours sitting up in a cramped airplane seat, so just keep lying there. Try listening to an audio book or music to see if it'll help you drift off to sleep, or at least enjoy the relaxation.
  - If you're the type to hit snooze a lot or sleep through alarm clocks, arrange for a loved one or the hotel to give you a wakeup call at a specific time. This is super important; if you sleep through your alarm during that first long nap, you could potentially really F up your sleep cycle for the entire trip, so do whatever you need to to ensure you wake up on time.
- If you did decide to nap (and if you managed to sleep and not just doze), when you wake up, you will feel absolutely awful. In fact, you'll probably feel worse than before you went to sleep and may think to yourself that taking a nap was a mistake. That feeling will subside within a few hours and by evening you'll be grateful that you did, trust me. Power through that feeling and force yourself to get up. Taking a long, hot shower after you wake up helps.
- If you're not napping or need to kill time before hotel check-in and the weather's decent, try to spend some time outside. A leisurely stroll in a local park is great. If you're feeling pretty ragged, even just sitting on a park bench for a while and breathing in fresh air will do you more good than you might realize.
- Once you're awake from your nap, follow the instructions in the next section ("[In the afternoon](#in-the-afternoon--if-your-flight-arrives-before-6pm)").

#### In the afternoon / If your flight arrives before ~6pm

- If you really didn't get any sleep at all on the plane and your flight arrives before ~2pm, you may still want to nap; see the section above this for specific guidance on how to nap. Depending on how late it is, you may want to just power nap for up to ~90 minutes instead of doing a longer nap. The most important thing is that you wake up while it's still light out; aim for your nap to end no later than ~1 hour before sunset.
- If you've decided to stay up, or once you're awake from your nap, try to get yourself out of your hotel room, ideally all the way up until dinner time if possible. The main reason is that as the day wears on and your fatigue starts to catch up to you, your bed will look more and more inviting, so the easiest way to deal with that is to remove yourself from temptation.
  - If you're visiting a place you've never been before, taking a city tour can be a great way to kill two birds with one stone: learn more about the place and force yourself to stay awake. Personally, I'm a huge fan of [free walking tours](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Walking_Tour); just Google "[city] free walking tour" to find options in your area. If you think walking for 2-3 hours is going to be too much given the limited energy you'll have, a cheesy touristy bus tour can also be a good option.
  - If the weather's really foul or for whatever reason there's just no good options for leaving the hotel, at least go down to the lobby and sit in a chair by the window.
- Drink plenty of fluids since you're likely feeling dehydrated from the plane. It should be safe at this point to consume caffeine, just don't drink any more than you normally would.
- If you need to eat lunch, do so, but try to avoid food that's heavy on carbs since it'll probably make you feel even sleepier. Something like a meal salad would be ideal.
- You might start to feel yourself getting hungry for dinner at, like, 4pm. Do your absolute best to power through the hunger pangs and avoid eating a meal until actual dinnertime. If you cannot make it through the afternoon without snacking, eat one of the granola bars or other snacks that you brought, or buy something like a bag of potato chips. Chips are actually pretty good right now because they're salty and will force you to drink more fluids.
- Then, follow the instructions in the next section ("[In the evening](#in-the-evening--if-your-flight-arrives-after-6pm)").

#### In the evening / If your flight arrives after 6pm

- Once it's dark out, no more napping. At all. Not even a 20-minute power nap. Remember the Golden Rule: just make it to 9pm.
- Unless your flight gets in really late (8pm+), you'll want to have dinner. Aim for a normal time but maybe push it just a _little_ later; for example, if you normally have dinner around 6:30pm, maybe try to push it to 7 this time. The reason is that the minute you're done eating, you'll probably feel overwhelmingly tired and ready for bed, so the later you can push dinner, the better.
  - Avoid a super heavy carby meal for that reason.
  - It's not a bad idea to have dessert since the sugar might be able to give you an extra 30~60 minutes of energy. Just don't go overboard and have something that will make you sugar crash super hard.
  - If you know somebody local, see if you can meet up with them for dinner. Make sure that they know and understand that you've just flown in and you're unlikely to be your usual energetic and talkative self; their job in this case is to entertain you and help you stay awake. A good friend will understand the assignment.
- Absolutely no caffeine under any circumstances at this point. Do drink fluids, but do so in moderation. One challenge that you're going to face soon is trying to sleep through the night, and if you drink a lot (even just water) and have to go to the bathroom constantly, that can be a problem.
- If your flight gets in late and you actually got _a lot_ of rest on the plane, you might have the opposite problem, where going to sleep on time can be a challenge; you should probably aim to be in bed no later than midnight, depending on what time you have to be up by in the morning (you should be aiming for 8-9 hours of sleep). If that's the case, the goal tonight is to wear yourself out; go for a run, hit up the hotel gym or pool, or do whatever you need to to burn up those energy reserves.

#### During the night

- If you've made it to 9pm, congratulations! If it's 8:30 and you just can't keep your eyes open any longer… that's all right. Try to stretch your getting-ready-for-bed routine as long as you can, but it's okay to cheat just a little.
- This is when you _should_ take your melatonin or sleep aid of choice. You might be thinking, "I'm so tired, I feel like I could sleep for 12 hours straight," but you'd be surprised at what your body will do; if you wake up at, say, 2am for any reason, you will likely find that you can't go back to sleep. That's where the drugs come in; they're there to increase the odds of you sleeping through the night, or help you go back to sleep if you do wake up.
- If you wake up and truly can't go back to sleep, take a "fake it 'til you make it" approach: stay in bed, stay horizontal, keep the lights off and the curtains closed, etc. Listen to an audiobook or music but try to avoid looking at screens. The _worst_ you can do at this point is get up and do things; that sends a signal to your body that Now Is A Time For Doing Things And Being Awake, which is bad because that's very hard to correct. The signal that you want to be sending your body is that now is a time for rest, so do your best to rest even if you're feeling restless.
- Absolutely no snacking during the night unless you feel like the hunger pangs will kill you. Being just a little hangry in the morning for breakfast is a good thing.

### Day 2

- Try to stay in bed until it's light outside, but once it is, it's okay to get up, even if it's early.
- You'll probably wake up feeling quite hungry, so go and eat a good breakfast. Just don't overeat so much that you want to immediately go back to your room and nap. The mission today is to try to make it to 9pm without napping _at all_ in between if possible.
- Caffeine is fine. Chances are you'll awaken with a pretty wicked headache; it feels a lot like a dehydration headache if you've ever had one of those. Coffee will actually help with that, as will drinking plenty of fluids. This is also why I recommend bringing aspirin or a headache remedy of choice. As I've gotten older, I've found the headaches to be the worst part of jetlag.
- Again, do your best to get yourself out of your room as much as possible. Not having a bed in your sightline will help avoid the temptation to nap.
- If you didn't get a good night's sleep, you will probably need a nap to get through the day. The window to do this is after lunch and before it gets dark out, and we're back to the Golden Rule now: definitely no longer than 90 minutes.
- It may seem like a minor thing, but focus on eating at normal mealtimes and avoiding snacking. If you're _really_ struggling, though, that's why you brought those granola bars.
- You will probably still want to take your melatonin or sleep aid of choice at night. The same challenges with sleeping through the previous night typically still persist on the second night.

### Day 3

- If you've done your best to follow all the above instructions, you'll hopefully get a decent night's sleep and wake up feeling a lot better on Day 3. You may still wake up with a headache, but it should be at least 50% less severe than the day before.
- The way you'll know whether you're relatively well-adjusted is if you start to get hungry at normal mealtimes and don't get too hungry in between.
- Whether or not you should still take melatonin/sleep aid on the third night is a toss-up. In an ideal world, you don't need the sleep aid from now on and can trust your body to do its thing. However, I've personally experienced a few trips where I slept totally fine the first two nights, and then woke up in the middle of the night and was tossing and turning for hours on the third night. So, just to decrease the odds of that happening, it's not a bad idea to still take your pills on the third night. But that should be the last time.

### Returning

- Various sources claim that there are significant differences between traveling west-to-east versus east-to-west and that the jetlag should also be handled differently. I haven't personally found there to be a material difference, so I always follow the above playbook on my return journey as well, including taking melatonin to help with sleep and being very careful about snacking and caffeine intake.
- The one difference I myself have noticed is that I am typically more tired on the return journey, no matter which direction I traveled, and that it takes me longer to recover. My personal theory on why that is is because you have the mental recovery from the entire trip to contend with on top of the physical challenges created by all the travel, so the sources of fatigue are doubled.
  - It's a good idea to plan and prepare for this in advance; don't plan for anything super strenuous the week after you return, as it could take 5-7 days to fully recover.

## Other Tips

- If you're like me and charge your phone overnight and have the [Adaptive Charging](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6090612?hl=en#adaptive_charging&zippy=%2Chow-to-use-adaptive-charging-pixel-later-including-fold) feature turned on to prolong battery life, you may want to disable that for the duration of your trip. Few things are more annoying than waking up at 6am, being unable to go back to sleep, and your phone not being charged.
